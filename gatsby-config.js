    about: `I have a four-year Atmospheric Science undergraduate degree from the University of British Columbia, completed in May of 2021. Throughout my degree I 
    was fortunate to be able to take courses in many different subjects, including computer science, oceanography, climate science, geography, geographic information science, 
    political science, and anthropology. I am currently looking for a environmental or climate science position where I can put my knowledge of atmospheric science, and all of the 
    skills I learned in my degree to a good use for the planet. `,
